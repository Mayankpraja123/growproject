Clone of Mpl.live
Hey there, hope you are doing well. I would like to introduce me first. My name is Mukundh. I am from non CS background . But currently learning Web Development in Masai School. At the end of every unit Construct week happens and this was our first construct week. We got a project where we have to clone MPL.live website with the time bound of seven days. But we have done our work just in three days by using HTML, CSS, JS.

So coming to the project, there is a lots of challenge we got. The below snapshot is landing page that is created by us which is almost similar to the landing page of MPL.live website. We used HTML and CSS for styling the website and some hover effects to the buttons in the page.

Responsive
We make sure that our website is fully responsive for all screen sizes. Screenshot (37).png

There are no sign up and sign in features in MPL.live but we included these features in our website. In the sign up page we are collecting the basic details of the user like name, email, password and storing it into localstorage and we make sure that if the same user try to sign up twice it shows popup of user already exist!. We achived that features using Javascript. Screenshot (39).png

Screenshot (40).png This has been a great and wonderful experience for us and whole team member to get coordinate with each other and build this website in a given time. The excitement of building a certain website almost similar to the main website was unexpectedly a good thing that we had. It is so satisfying. while building a website and merging on a github to the main page. There are many conflicts occurs while merging the pages. But the more you do it, the better you become.

It is not just about coding, it is about problem-solving. I have always believed in learning by building the code. This project could not have been made possible without the contribution of my fellow colleagues.
